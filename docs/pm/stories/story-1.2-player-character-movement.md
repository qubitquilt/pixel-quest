# **Story 1.2: Player Character & Movement**

## **Status**

* \[x\] Draft  
* \[ \] Approved  
* \[ \] InProgress  
* \[ \] Review  
* \[ \] Done

## **Story**

As a player,  
I want to see my character on the screen and move them around,  
so that I can explore the world.

## **Acceptance Criteria**

1. A simple 8-bit sprite representing the Warrior character is rendered on the canvas.  
2. The player can move the character sprite up, down, left, and right using WASD and Arrow Keys.  
3. The character sprite is constrained within the boundaries of the visible game canvas.  
4. The character animates appropriately when moving in each of the four directions.

## **Tasks / Subtasks**

* \[ \] Create a Player class or component in the client package.  
* \[ \] Load a simple placeholder sprite sheet for the Warrior character.  
* \[ \] Add logic to the Player class to render the sprite using PixiJS.  
* \[ \] Implement input handling for keyboard events (WASD and Arrow Keys).  
* \[ \] Create a game loop that updates the player's position based on input.  
* \[ \] Add boundary-checking logic to prevent the player from moving off-screen.  
* \[ \] Implement simple animation logic to switch between different frames on the sprite sheet based on movement direction.

## **Dev Notes**

This story builds on the basic PixiJS canvas from story-1.1-project-scaffolding-basic-rendering. The focus is on creating a visible, controllable entity that will be the core of the player's interaction with the game world.

### **Architecture Alignment**

* **Frontend Components**: This introduces the first major frontend component, the Player.  
* **Game Logic Engine**: The movement and animation logic forms the initial part of the client-side game logic.

### **Tech Stack**

* **Frontend Framework**: PixiJS (7.x) for rendering and sprite handling.  
* **Frontend Language**: JavaScript (ES6+)

## **Testing**

* Developer should manually verify that the warrior sprite appears and moves correctly with both WASD and arrow keys.  
* Verify that the sprite cannot be moved outside the 800x600 canvas.  
* Confirm that the sprite changes appearance/frame when moving in each of the four cardinal directions.
