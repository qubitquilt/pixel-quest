# Story 1.2: Display Shareable URL

**Status:** Complete

**Story**
**As a** host,
**I want** to see a unique, shareable URL on the lobby screen,
**so that** I can easily invite my friends.

**Acceptance Criteria**
1. When the host enters the lobby, a unique URL for the current game session is displayed.
2. The URL displayed on the screen includes the full page address (e.g., `https://<your-domain>/lobby/<roomId>`).
3. The host can easily copy the URL to their clipboard (e.g., via a "Copy Link" button).
4. When another player navigates to the copied URL, they are taken to the correct game lobby.

**Tasks / Subtasks**
- [x] **Frontend: Display Lobby URL** (AC: 1, 2)
    - [x] In `packages/client/pages/lobby/[roomId].tsx`, retrieve the `roomId` from the URL router.
    - [x] Construct the full, shareable URL using the `window.location.origin` and the `roomId`.
    - [x] Display the generated URL in a read-only input field or a text element.
- [x] **Frontend: Implement Copy-to-Clipboard** (AC: 3)
    - [x] Add a "Copy Link" button next to the displayed URL.
    - [x] On button click, use the browser's Clipboard API (`navigator.clipboard.writeText`) to copy the URL to the user's clipboard.
    - [x] Provide visual feedback to the user that the link has been copied (e.g., change button text to "Copied!").
- [x] **Testing** (AC: 1, 2, 3, 4)
    - [x] Write a test to verify the lobby page correctly displays the full shareable URL.
    - [x] Write a test to simulate a click on the "Copy Link" button and verify the clipboard API is called with the correct URL.
    - [x] Manually verify that pasting the URL into a new browser tab successfully loads the lobby.

**Dev Notes**
- **PO Feedback Incorporated**:
    - **Edge Cases**: Consider the case where `navigator.clipboard.writeText` might fail or not be supported. Provide fallback or graceful error handling.
    - **Accessibility**: Ensure the copy button and any related UI are fully accessible (keyboard navigable, screen-reader friendly).
- **Previous Story Insights**:
    - The lobby page at `packages/client/pages/lobby/[roomId].tsx` was created in Story 1.1 and is the primary file to be modified.
    - The testing environment has known issues with `mocha` and `ts-node`. While tests should be written, be prepared for execution challenges.
- **Technology Stack:**
    - Frontend: Next.js, TypeScript, React [Source: `docs/architecture/2-tech-stack.md`]
    - UI Components: **shadcn/ui** is available for creating components like the button and input field. [Source: `docs/architecture/2-tech-stack.md`]
- **Project Structure:**
    - All changes will be within the `packages/client` directory, primarily on the `pages/lobby/[roomId].tsx` page. New components can be added to `packages/client/components/`. [Source: `docs/architecture/4-unified-project-structure.md`]
- **Frontend Architecture:**
    - This story involves updating the React-based UI. State for the URL and copy button can be managed with React's `useState` hook. [Source: `docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md`]
- **Core Workflows:**
    - This story facilitates the "Player Joins Game" workflow by providing the necessary link for other players to join. [Source: `docs/architecture/5-core-workflows.md#5.1. Player Joins Game`]
- **Data Models:**
    - No new data models are required for this story. [Source: `docs/architecture/3-data-models.md`]

**Testing**
- No specific testing strategy document was found.
- The developer should add component tests for the new UI elements.
- Given the issues noted in Story 1.1, manual verification will be critical.

**Change Log**
| Date | Version | Description | Author |
