# **Story 1.3: Procedural Tilemap Generation**

## **Story**

As a player,  
I want to explore a dynamically generated world,  
so that every adventure feels unique.

## **Acceptance Criteria**

1. The client can procedurally generate a simple tile-based map (e.g., a grassy field with some trees).  
2. The player character can collide with solid tiles (like trees) and cannot move through them.  
3. The map is larger than the visible screen, requiring the player to move to see new areas (i.e., camera follows the player).

## **Tasks / Subtasks**

* \[ \] Create a WorldMap or Tilemap class in the client package.  
* \[ \] Implement a simple procedural generation algorithm (e.g., using Perlin noise or random placement) to create a 2D array representing the map.  
* \[ \] Load tile sprites (e.g., grass, tree).  
* \[ \] Add rendering logic to the WorldMap class to draw the tiles onto the PixiJS stage.  
* \[ \] Modify the player movement logic to check for collisions with solid tiles (trees).  
* \[ \] Implement a camera-follow system where the PixiJS stage's position is updated to keep the player centered on the screen.

## **Dev Notes**

This story introduces the game world. The generation should be simple for now, focusing on the core mechanics of creating a map and handling interactions between the player and the map tiles.

### **Architecture Alignment**

* **AI-Driven Content Generation**: This is a precursor to the Gemini-driven generation. We start with a simple client-side algorithm to prove out the concept.  
* **World Renderer**: The logic to draw the tilemap is the beginning of the World Renderer component.  
* **Shared Code**: The data structure for the map might be a candidate for future sharing between client and server.

### **Tech Stack**

* **Frontend Framework**: PixiJS (7.x) for tile rendering.  
* **Frontend Language**: JavaScript (ES6+)

## **Testing**

* Verify that a tile-based map is rendered behind the player character.  
* Confirm the player sprite cannot move through tree tiles but can move over grass tiles.  
* Verify that as the player moves, the map scrolls to keep the player sprite in the center of the view.
