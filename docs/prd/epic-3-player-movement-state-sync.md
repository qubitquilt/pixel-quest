# **Epic 3: Player Movement & State Sync**

**Epic Goal:** To enable player control of characters and synchronize their positions across all clients in real-time.

* **Story 3.1:** As a player, I want my keyboard inputs to move my character on my screen so that I can control my player.  
* **Story 3.2:** As a player, I want my client to send my position updates to the server so that my movements are part of the official game state.  
* **Story 3.3:** As a server, I want to receive position updates and broadcast them to all other clients so that everyone's game is synchronized.  
* **Story 3.4:** As a player, I want to see my opponents' characters moving on my screen based on server updates so that I know where they are.  
* **Story 3.5:** As a developer, I need to implement collision detection between players and maze walls so that players cannot walk through them.
