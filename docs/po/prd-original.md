# **Pixel Quest Product Requirements Document (PRD)**

## **Goals and Background Context**

### **Goals**

* **Deliver a Playable MVP:** Create a feature-complete version of the game with 1-4 player support, turn-based combat, and **the first main quest fully implemented**.  
* **Showcase Technical Pillars:** Successfully implement a persistent, procedurally generated world and stable multiplayer functionality using PixiJS.  
* **Foster Collaboration:** Serve as a successful and enjoyable father-son learning and collaboration project.  
* **Achieve High Engagement:** Ensure a majority of player groups who start a quest are able to successfully complete it together.  
* **Ensure Intuitive Onboarding:** A new player should be able to understand and perform core actions (move, attack) within the first 5 minutes of play without extensive tutorials.  
* **Promote Cooperative Play:** Encourage players to use teamwork to overcome challenges, such as reviving teammates and solving team-based puzzles.

### **Background Context**

Many modern cooperative games are too complex for casual, drop-in play sessions, especially for families with players of varying skill levels. At the same time, classic retro-style games often lack robust, built-in multiplayer functionality. This project aims to fill that gap.

"Pixel Quest" is a top-down, 8-bit adventure game for 1-4 players that combines the charm of classic RPGs with modern cooperative design. It features a dynamically generated yet persistent world, non-linear quests, and strategic turn-based combat designed to be accessible and family-friendly. The core objective is to provide a shared, G-rated social experience where players can work together to achieve collective goals.

## **Requirements**

### **Functional**

1. **FR1: Player Management:** The game must support 1 to 4 concurrent players in a single game session.  
2. **FR2: Character Selection:** At the start of a session, each player must be able to select a hero from available classes (e.g., Warrior, Mage, Archer, Tinkerer). For the MVP, only the Warrior class is required.  
3. **FR3: World Generation:** The game world must be dynamically generated as players explore new areas. Once an area is generated, its state (layout, landmarks) must be persistent for the duration of the session.  
4. **FR4: Overworld Exploration:** Players must be able to navigate their characters through the generated world using top-down controls.  
5. **FR5: Enemy Engagement:** When a player makes contact with an enemy in the overworld, the game must transition all nearby party members to a dedicated combat screen.  
6. **FR6: Turn-Based Combat:** Combat must be turn-based. On their turn, a player must be able to choose actions for their character, including a "Primary Attack" and a "Special Attack."  
7. **FR7: Stamina System:** Special Attacks must consume a finite "Stamina" resource. This resource should not regenerate automatically during combat but can be restored through other means (e.g., items, resting).  
8. **FR8: Non-Linear Quests:** The game must present players with major quests that can be completed in any order. For the MVP, at least two main quests must be fully implemented.  
9. **FR9: Multiplayer Loot System:** Common loot (e.g., coins, consumables) dropped by enemies must be instanced for each player. Key quest items or unique gear must be shared with the entire party upon pickup.  
10. **FR10: Player Defeat & Revival:** When a player's health reaches zero during combat, they are removed from the current battle. They must be automatically revived with partial health after the battle concludes successfully.  
11. **FR11: Team-Based Puzzles:** Quests may include puzzles that are designed for teamwork but must also be solvable by a single player to ensure game progression is never halted.

### **Non-Functional**

1. **NFR1: Technology Stack:** The game client must be built using the PixiJS rendering engine.  
2. **NFR2: Multiplayer Stability:** The network session for a 4-player game must remain stable without critical errors or disconnections for at least one continuous hour of gameplay.  
3. **NFR3: Combat Transition Speed:** The transition from overworld exploration to the turn-based combat screen (and back again) must complete in under 2 seconds.  
4. **NFR4: Aesthetic Cycles:** The game must feature a day/night cycle and seasonal changes. These changes are purely aesthetic and must not impact core game mechanics.  
5. **NFR5: Content Rating:** All game content, including visuals, text, and themes, must be G-rated and appropriate for a family-friendly audience (ages 8+).  
6. **NFR6: Onboarding Simplicity:** Core mechanics (movement, primary attack) must be intuitive enough for a new player to grasp within the first 5 minutes of gameplay without a lengthy, forced tutorial.

## **User Interface Design Goals**

### **Overall UX Vision**

The user experience should be simple, intuitive, and immediately familiar to anyone who has played a classic top-down adventure game. The UI must be clean and unobtrusive, keeping the focus on exploration and cooperative play. All interactions, from menu navigation to combat commands, should be easily understandable for an 8-year-old player.

### **Key Interaction Paradigms**

* **Overworld:** Direct control via keyboard (WASD/Arrow Keys) or gamepad. Interaction with objects (chests, NPCs) will be a single button press when adjacent.  
* **Combat:** Menu-driven, turn-based commands. Players will select actions from a simple list (Attack, Special, Item, Flee).  
* **Menus:** Full-screen overlay for inventory, quest log, and game options. Navigation will be simple, using up/down/select controls.

### **Core Screens and Views**

* **Title Screen:** Presents the game title and options to "Start New Game" or "Join Game".  
* **Character Select Screen:** A simple screen where each player (1-4) can choose their character class.  
* **Overworld HUD:** A minimal heads-up display showing the player's health, stamina, and currently selected item. For multiplayer, it will show a condensed status for all party members.  
* **Combat Screen:** A dedicated view showing the player characters on one side and enemies on the other. A command menu will be clearly visible at the bottom for the active player.  
* **Main Menu / Inventory:** A grid-based inventory screen for viewing and using items. Will also have tabs for Quest Log, Party Status, and Options.

### **Accessibility: WCAG AA**

While we are aiming for a retro aesthetic, the UI must meet modern accessibility standards. This includes clear, high-contrast text, distinguishable UI elements without relying solely on color, and full navigability using only a keyboard or gamepad.

### **Branding**

The branding should evoke the classic 8-bit era. This means pixel art, a limited but vibrant color palette, and chiptune-style music and sound effects. The overall feel should be adventurous and slightly whimsical, avoiding anything too dark or serious to maintain its G-rated, family-friendly appeal.

### **Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive**

The primary target is a web browser on a desktop or laptop. The game's display should be responsive, adapting cleanly to different browser window sizes and screen resolutions. While not a primary target for the MVP, the design should not preclude future support for mobile or tablet browsers with on-screen controls.

## **Technical Assumptions**

### **Repository Structure: Monorepo**

* **Decision:** The project will be housed in a single monorepo. This repository will contain both the game client code and the backend server code.  
* **Rationale:** This approach simplifies dependency management and ensures that the client and server can easily share code (e.g., for game state models or constants). It makes coordinated changes much easier to manage, which is crucial for a small team.

### **Service Architecture**

* **Decision:** The initial architecture will be a simple **Monolith**. A single Node.js server application will handle all backend responsibilities, including managing player connections, synchronizing game state, and broadcasting events.  
* **Rationale:** A monolith is the fastest and most straightforward way to build our MVP. It avoids the unnecessary complexity of a microservices architecture, allowing us to focus on core gameplay features first.

### **Testing Requirements**

* **Decision:** The project will require both **Unit and Integration tests**.  
* **Rationale:** Unit tests will ensure individual functions and components (like a combat calculator or a loot generator) work correctly in isolation. Integration tests will be critical for verifying the communication layer between the game client and the backend server, ensuring a stable multiplayer experience.

### **Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests**

* **Real-time Communication:** The multiplayer functionality must be built using **WebSockets**. The Socket.IO library is recommended for its robust features and ease of use in managing real-time, bi-directional communication between the clients and the server.  
* **Game State Authority:** The backend server will be the single source of truth (authoritative) for the core game state to prevent cheating and ensure consistency across all players. Clients will send their intended actions to the server, and the server will validate them and broadcast the new state back to all clients.

## **Epic List**

* **Epic 1: Core Engine & Solo Gameplay Loop:** Establish the foundational project setup, render a player character, enable overworld movement, and implement the basic single-player combat loop.  
* **Epic 2: Multiplayer & Session Management:** Implement the backend server, enable multiple players to connect to a shared session, and synchronize player movement and state in the overworld.  
* **Epic 3: Quest System & First Quest:** Develop the mechanics for managing quest states and implement the first complete quest, including objectives, NPCs, and a unique boss encounter.

## **Epic 1: Core Engine & Solo Gameplay Loop**

**Epic Goal:** To establish a playable, single-player experience that proves out the core technical foundations of the game, including rendering, movement, and the fundamental turn-based combat system.

### **Story 1.1: Project Scaffolding & Basic Rendering**

**As a** developer, **I want** to set up the monorepo structure with a PixiJS client and a Node.js server, **so that** I can render a basic game screen.

* **Acceptance Criteria:**  
  1. A monorepo is initialized with separate packages for client and server.  
  2. The client package is configured with PixiJS and can render a black 800x600 canvas in a web browser.  
  3. The server package has a basic Node.js and Express setup that can serve the client application.

### **Story 1.2: Player Character & Movement**

**As a** player, **I want** to see my character on the screen and move them around, **so that** I can explore the world.

* **Acceptance Criteria:**  
  1. A simple 8-bit sprite representing the Warrior character is rendered on the canvas.  
  2. The player can move the character sprite up, down, left, and right using WASD and Arrow Keys.  
  3. The character sprite is constrained within the boundaries of the visible game canvas.  
  4. The character animates appropriately when moving in each of the four directions.

### **Story 1.3: Procedural Tilemap Generation**

**As a** player, **I want** to explore a dynamically generated world, **so that** every adventure feels unique.

* **Acceptance Criteria:**  
  1. The client can procedurally generate a simple tile-based map (e.g., a grassy field with some trees).  
  2. The player character can collide with solid tiles (like trees) and cannot move through them.  
  3. The map is larger than the visible screen, requiring the player to move to see new areas (i.e., camera follows the player).

### **Story 1.4: Overworld Enemy & Combat Transition**

**As a** player, **I want** to encounter enemies in the world and transition to a battle, **so that** I can engage in combat.

* **Acceptance Criteria:**  
  1. Stationary enemy sprites are rendered on the overworld map.  
  2. When the player character's sprite collides with an enemy sprite, the game view switches from the overworld map to a dedicated combat screen.  
  3. After combat (simulated for now), the view transitions back to the overworld, and the defeated enemy sprite is removed.

### **Story 1.5: Turn-Based Combat System (Solo)**

**As a** player, **I want** to fight enemies in a turn-based system, **so that** I can defeat them using strategy.

* **Acceptance Criteria:**  
  1. On the combat screen, the player's character and the enemy are displayed.  
  2. A UI menu appears allowing the player to select "Attack" or "Special Attack".  
  3. Selecting "Attack" deals a fixed amount of damage to the enemy.  
  4. The enemy retaliates by dealing a fixed amount of damage to the player.  
  5. Turns alternate between the player and the enemy until one's health reaches zero.  
  6. The "Special Attack" option is present but can be non-functional for this story.  
  7. Health for both player and enemy is displayed on screen and updates correctly.

## **Epic 2: Multiplayer & Session Management**

**Epic Goal:** To transform the single-player experience into a fully cooperative one by implementing the network architecture, allowing multiple players to join a game, see each other, and interact within the same game world.

### **Story 2.1: Basic WebSocket Server**

**As a** developer, **I want** to set up a WebSocket server using Socket.IO, **so that** game clients can establish a persistent, real-time connection.

* **Acceptance Criteria:**  
  1. The Node.js server has Socket.IO integrated.  
  2. The server can accept incoming WebSocket connections from clients.  
  3. The server can log a message when a client connects and disconnects.  
  4. The server maintains a list of all currently connected clients.

### **Story 2.2: Client Connection & Session Creation**

**As a** player, **I want** to connect to the game server and join a game session, **so that** I can play with others.

* **Acceptance Criteria:**  
  1. The PixiJS client establishes a WebSocket connection to the server on startup.  
  2. The first player to connect creates a new game session on the server.  
  3. Subsequent players are automatically added to the existing session.  
  4. Each connected player is assigned a unique ID by the server.

### **Story 2.3: Multiplayer Character Spawning & State Sync**

**As a** player, **I want** to see other players' characters in the game world, **so that** we can explore together.

* **Acceptance Criteria:**  
  1. When a player connects, the server sends them the current state of all other players (position, character class).  
  2. The client renders sprites for all other connected players at their correct positions.  
  3. When a new player joins, the server broadcasts a "player joined" event to all existing clients, who then render the new player's character.  
  4. When a player disconnects, the server broadcasts a "player left" event, and their sprite is removed from all other clients' games.

### **Story 2.4: Real-time Movement Synchronization**

**As a** player, **I want** to see other players move in real-time, **so that** the world feels alive and we can coordinate our actions.

* **Acceptance Criteria:**  
  1. When a player moves, their client sends their new position to the server.  
  2. The server broadcasts this position update to all other connected clients.  
  3. Clients receive the position updates and smoothly interpolate the other player sprites to their new positions.  
  4. Movement synchronization should feel responsive with minimal visible lag on a local network.

## **Epic 3: Quest System & First Quest**

**Epic Goal:** To implement the systems necessary for questing and to create one full, playable quest from start to finish, including puzzle elements and a unique boss battle, thereby completing the core gameplay loop for the MVP.

### **Story 3.1: Quest Management System**

**As a** developer, **I want** a system to define and track quest states, **so that** I can create and manage quests for the players.

* **Acceptance Criteria:**  
  1. A data structure (e.g., JSON object) is created on the server to define quests, including their objectives, states (e.g., "not started", "in progress", "completed"), and any associated data.  
  2. The server can track the state of each main quest for the party.  
  3. A basic UI element is added to the Main Menu to display the current status of the main quests.

### **Story 3.2: First Quest \- "The Sunstone Well"**

**As a** player, **I want** to receive and complete a quest to reclaim The Sunstone Well, **so that** I can achieve a major objective.

* **Acceptance Criteria:**  
  1. The "Reclaim the Sunstone Well" quest is defined in the quest system and is available from the start.  
  2. A new, specific area for the Sunstone Well is generated in the world.  
  3. The quest objectives are displayed in the Quest Log UI.  
  4. Completing the quest involves defeating a specific boss located within the Sunstone Well area.

### **Story 3.3: Team-Based Puzzle**

**As a** player, **I want** to solve a puzzle with my teammates, **so that** we can progress through the quest.

* **Acceptance Criteria:**  
  1. The Sunstone Well area contains a simple puzzle, such as requiring two players to stand on separate pressure plates simultaneously to open a door.  
  2. The puzzle state is synchronized across all clients.  
  3. The puzzle is designed to be solvable by a single player (e.g., by finding a heavy object to place on one of the plates).

### **Story 3.4: Boss Battle Encounter**

**As a** player, **I want** to fight a unique and challenging boss at the end of a quest, **so that** I feel a sense of accomplishment.

* **Acceptance Criteria:**
