Facilitator: Mary (Business Analyst)  
Participant: User

## **Executive Summary**

**Topic:** An 8-bit style, 4-player multiplayer Zelda-clone game using PixiJS.

**Session Goals:** To create a focused idea with a defined storyline, outlined game mechanics, and a structured quest system.

**Techniques Used:** Progressive Flow (First Principles Thinking, Mind Mapping)

**Total Ideas Generated:** 7 core concepts

## **Technique Sessions**

### **First Principles Thinking \- Building the World**

**Description:** Breaking down the core concepts of the game (world, heroes, conflict) to build a unique foundation from scratch.

**Ideas Generated:**

* **The World:**  
  * **Theme:** A vast, open-world style kingdom that has fallen to an invasion of "living machines." These machines have corrupted the land with mechanical churn.  
  * **Dynamic Elements:**  
    * Seasons change at set, regular intervals (e.g., every few hours of gameplay).  
    * The day/night cycle is synchronized with the primary player's real-world timezone.  
  * **Generation:** The world is generated dynamically as players explore, but once a region is generated, it becomes persistent.  
* **The Heroes:**  
  * **Archetypes:** The game supports up to 4 simultaneous players, who select from available classic hero archetypes.  
  * **Classes:**  
    * **Warrior:** Specializes in strength and close-quarters combat.  
    * **Mage:** Wields special magical powers.  
    * **Archer:** Attacks effectively from a distance.  
    * **Tinkerer/Mechanic (Suggested):** Specializes in disabling robotic enemies, setting traps, and using gadgets.  
* **The Conflict:**  
  * **Antagonists:** The kingdom has been taken over by mechanical robots.  
  * **Goal:** Players must reclaim the kingdom piece by piece by defeating and dismantling these robots.  
  * **Quest Structure:** The robots have implanted themselves into key infrastructure. Each major quest involves liberating one of these areas.  
  * **Bosses:** There is no single "dark lord." Instead, each major quest culminates in a fight against a unique "quest boss" robot that requires specific strategies and teamwork to defeat.

**Insights Discovered:**

* The combination of dynamic world elements with a persistent map creates a unique and replayable experience.  
* The episodic quest structure is perfect for multiplayer sessions.  
* The focus on varied mechanical bosses emphasizes teamwork and strategy.

**Notable Connections:**

* The "Tinkerer" hero class directly connects to the primary conflict with mechanical enemies.

### **Mind Mapping \- Game Mechanics**

**Description:** Branching out from the core concepts to define the specific rules and systems of the game.

**Ideas Generated:**

* **Combat System:**  
  * **Style:** Turn-based combat.  
  * **Transition:** When an enemy is engaged in the overworld, the scene transitions/zooms into a dedicated combat screen.  
  * **Actions:** Players can choose between a "Primary Attack" and a "Special Attack."  
  * **Stamina:** Special attacks consume a stamina resource, which limits their use.  
* **Quest System:**  
  * **Objective:** The main quests are assigned from the start and involve retaking 5 key infrastructure components of the kingdom from robot control.  
  * **Progression:** The 5 main quests can be completed in any order (non-linear).  
  * **Gameplay Loop:** To complete a quest, heroes travel to the target area, encountering enemies, finding power-ups, upgrading weapons, and collecting coins along the way.  
  * **Suggested Components to Reclaim:**  
    1. The Sunstone Well (Controls water and agriculture)  
    2. The Citadel Walls (The kingdom's main defense)  
    3. The Astral Observatory (The center of magical power)  
    4. The Grand Clocktower (Regulates time and machinery)  
    5. The Sky-Forge (Source of the kingdom's finest weapons)  
* **Multiplayer Mechanics:**  
  * **Loot System (Suggested):** Use an "instanced loot" system. Common drops (coins, consumables) are given to each player individually. Important quest items or gear are shared with the whole party upon pickup.  
  * **Defeat & Revival:** When a player's health reaches zero, they are removed from the current battle. They are automatically revived with partial health after the battle concludes.  
  * **Puzzles:** Team-based puzzles should be designed to support all available character classes but must also be solvable by a single player, ensuring game progression is never halted.  
* **World Interactions:**  
  * **Seasons:** Seasonal changes affect the landscape's appearance (e.g., snow in winter, falling leaves in autumn) but are purely aesthetic and do not alter gameplay mechanics.  
  * **Crafting/Building:** Players cannot build structures or craft items. The focus is on adventure and combat.

**Insights Discovered:**

* The non-linear quest structure gives players a strong sense of freedom.  
* The turn-based combat slows down the action, making it more strategic and suitable for a thoughtful multiplayer experience.  
* The puzzle design principle ensures that the game is enjoyable both solo and with a full party.

## **Action Planning**

**Top Priority Idea:** Formalize the brainstormed concepts into a structured Project Brief.

**Next Steps:**

1. **Create Project Brief:** Use the information gathered in this session to populate a formal Project Brief. This will include defining the problem, the proposed solution, target users (players), core features for an MVP (Minimum Viable Product), and technical considerations.  
2. **Define MVP Scope:** As part of the brief, we will decide what core features are needed for the very first playable version of the game. For example, the MVP might include just one hero class (the Warrior), one of the five quests, and the core combat and multiplayer mechanics.  
3. **Handoff to Product Manager:** Once the Project Brief is complete, it will be handed off to the Product Manager (PM) to create the detailed Product Requirements Document (PRD) and user stories.
