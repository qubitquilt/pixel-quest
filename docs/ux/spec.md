# **Pixel Quest UI/UX Specification**

## **Introduction**

This document defines the user experience goals, information architecture, user flows, and visual design specifications for the "Pixel Quest" user interface. It serves as the foundation for visual design and frontend development, ensuring a cohesive and user-centered experience based on the approved Product Requirements Document (PRD).

### **Overall UX Goals & Principles**

#### **Target User Personas**

* **The Family Adventurers:** This group includes parents playing with their children (ages 8+), siblings, or groups of friends looking for a casual, non-competitive cooperative game. They have varying levels of gaming experience and value an experience that is easy to learn but offers enough depth to remain engaging.

#### **Usability Goals**

* **Ease of Learning:** A new player can understand and perform core actions (move, attack) within the first 5 minutes of gameplay.  
* **Efficiency of Use:** Common actions in combat and menus can be performed with minimal clicks or button presses.  
* **Clarity:** All UI elements and text are immediately understandable to a player aged 8 and up.  
* **Error Prevention:** The UI will use clear confirmations for any significant choices to prevent accidental actions.

#### **Design Principles**

1. **Clarity Over Cleverness:** Prioritize clear, simple UI patterns over complex or novel interactions.  
2. **Retro Authenticity:** The design should feel like a genuine, high-quality game from the classic 8-bit era.  
3. **Focus on the World:** The UI should be minimal and unobtrusive, keeping the player's attention on the game world and their teammates.  
4. **Accessible by Default:** Design decisions will start from a foundation of accessibility, ensuring the game is playable by the widest possible audience.

## **Information Architecture (IA)**

### **Site Map / Screen Inventory**

This diagram shows the relationship between the core screens of the game.

    A\[Title Screen\] \--\> B(Character Select);  
    A \--\> C(Join Game);  
    B \--\> D{Overworld};  
    D \-- Encounter Enemy \--\> E(Combat Screen);  
    E \-- Battle Ends \--\> D;  
    D \-- Open Menu \--\> F(Main Menu);  
    F \--\> G\[Inventory\];  
    F \--\> H\[Quest Log\];  
    F \--\> I\[Party Status\];  
    F \--\> J\[Options\];  
    F \-- Close Menu \--\> D;

### **Navigation Structure**

* **Primary Navigation:** The primary "navigation" is the player's movement through the game world itself.  
* **Menu Navigation:** A single button press (e.g., 'Enter' or 'Start') from the Overworld will open the full-screen Main Menu. From there, players will use directional keys to navigate between the different tabs (Inventory, Quest Log, etc.).

## **User Flows**

### **Core Gameplay Loop**

This flow represents the primary minute-to-minute experience for a player.

* **User Goal:** To explore the world, fight monsters, and complete objectives.  
* **Entry Points:** Starting a new game after character selection.  
* **Success Criteria:** The player can seamlessly repeat the loop of exploration and combat.

## **Wireframes & Mockups**

Detailed, pixel-perfect mockups will be created and maintained in a dedicated design file (e.g., Figma). This document will describe the key components of each screen in text.

### **Key Screen Layouts**

#### **Overworld HUD**

* **Purpose:** To provide essential, at-a-glance information without cluttering the screen.  
* **Key Elements:**  
  * Top-left corner: Health and Stamina bars for the player's character.  
  * Top-right corner: Condensed view of teammates' health.  
  * Bottom-center: Icon for the currently equipped item.  
* **Interaction Notes:** This is a display-only screen; no direct interaction.

#### **Combat Screen**

* **Purpose:** To provide a clear, strategic view of the battle and available actions.  
* **Key Elements:**  
  * Left side of screen: Player party sprites and their health/stamina bars.  
  * Right side of screen: Enemy sprites and their health bars.  
  * Bottom of screen: A menu box for the active player with command options (Attack, Special, Item, Flee).  
* **Interaction Notes:** The active player uses directional keys to select a command and a target.

## **Component Library / Design System**

* **Design System Approach:** We will create a small, bespoke set of 8-bit components to ensure a consistent retro aesthetic.

### **Core Components**

* **Button:** A pixelated button with a simple border and a hover/pressed state (e.g., color inversion).  
* **Menu Panel:** A rectangular panel with a decorative pixelated border, used for all menus and dialogue boxes.  
* **Health/Stamina Bar:** A horizontal bar made of individual pixel blocks that deplete as the value decreases.  
* **Text Box:** Text will be rendered in a classic 8-bit bitmap font.

## **Branding & Style Guide**

* **Brand Guidelines:** The visual identity is defined by the 8-bit, retro-adventure aesthetic as outlined in the PRD.

### **Color Palette**

| Color Type | Hex Code | Usage |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Primary | \#29ADFF | UI Borders, Highlights |
| Secondary | \#FF3B3B | Damage, Health Bars (Empty) |
| Accent | \#FFD700 | Important Items, Gold |
| Success | \#3BFF8A | Positive Feedback, Health Bars (Full) |
| Neutral | \#FFFFFF, \#000000 | Text, Backgrounds |

### **Typography**

* **Primary Font:** A classic, readable 8-bit bitmap font (e.g., "Press Start 2P").  
* **Type Scale:**  
  * H1 (Titles): 16pt  
  * Body (Menus, Dialogue): 8pt

## **Accessibility Requirements**

* **Compliance Target:** WCAG 2.1 Level AA.  
* **Key Requirements:**  
  * **Visual:** All UI text must have a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 against its background. Focus indicators (e.g., a flashing cursor in menus) must be highly visible.  
  * **Interaction:** The entire game, including all menus, must be fully navigable and playable using only a keyboard or a standard gamepad.

## **Next Steps**

This document provides the necessary design and user experience foundation. The next step is for the **Architect** to use this specification, in conjunction with the PRD, to create the detailed **Fullstack Architecture Document**.
