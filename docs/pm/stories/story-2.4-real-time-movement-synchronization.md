# **Story 2.4: Real-time Movement Synchronization**

## **Status**

* \[x\] Draft  
* \[ \] Approved  
* \[ \] InProgress  
* \[ \] Review  
* \[ \] Done

## **Story**

As a player,  
I want to see other players move in real-time,  
so that the world feels alive and we can coordinate our actions.

## **Acceptance Criteria**

1. When a player moves, their client sends their new position to the server.  
2. The server broadcasts this position update to all other connected clients.  
3. Clients receive the position updates and smoothly interpolate the other player sprites to their new positions.  
4. Movement synchronization should feel responsive with minimal visible lag on a local network.

## **Tasks / Subtasks**

* \[ \] On the client, whenever the local player's position changes, emit a playerMovement event to the server with the new x and y coordinates.  
* \[ \] On the server, listen for the playerMovement event.  
* \[ \] When the server receives a playerMovement event, update that player's position in the server-side game state.  
* \[ \] Broadcast the updated position data to all *other* clients.  
* \[ \] On the client, listen for the movement broadcast from the server.  
* \[ \] When a client receives a movement update for another player, update the position of that player's sprite on the screen.  
* \[ \] (Optional but recommended) Implement simple interpolation (lerping) on the client to smooth the movement of other players' sprites between updates.

## **Dev Notes**

This story completes the core multiplayer exploration loop. The world now feels shared and alive. This is a critical technical milestone.

### **Architecture Alignment**

* **Authoritative Server**: The server validates and broadcasts all movement, making it the source of truth for player positions.  
* **Game State Manager**: The manager is now actively updating the player states in real-time.  
* **API Specification**: Implements the playerMovement client-to-server and server-to-client events.

### **Tech Stack**

* **Real-time Engine**: Socket.IO (4.x)

## **Testing**

* Start server, launch client 1 and client 2\.  
* On client 1, move the player character around the screen.  
* Verify on client 2 that client 1's character sprite moves in sync.  
* On client 2, move the player character.  
* Verify on client 1 that client 2's sprite moves accordingly. The movement should appear smooth.
