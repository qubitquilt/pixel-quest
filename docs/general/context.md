# **Goals and Background Context**

### **Goals**

* **Deliver a Playable MVP:** Create a feature-complete version of the game with 1-4 player support, turn-based combat, and **the first main quest fully implemented**.  
* **Showcase Technical Pillars:** Successfully implement a persistent, procedurally generated world and stable multiplayer functionality using PixiJS.  
* **Foster Collaboration:** Serve as a successful and enjoyable father-son learning and collaboration project.  
* **Achieve High Engagement:** Ensure a majority of player groups who start a quest are able to successfully complete it together.  
* **Ensure Intuitive Onboarding:** A new player should be able to understand and perform core actions (move, attack) within the first 5 minutes of play without extensive tutorials.  
* **Promote Cooperative Play:** Encourage players to use teamwork to overcome challenges, such as reviving teammates and solving team-based puzzles.

### **Background Context**

Many modern cooperative games are too complex for casual, drop-in play sessions, especially for families with players of varying skill levels. At the same time, classic retro-style games often lack robust, built-in multiplayer functionality. This project aims to fill that gap.

"Pixel Quest" is a top-down, 8-bit adventure game for 1-4 players that combines the charm of classic RPGs with modern cooperative design. It features a dynamically generated yet persistent world, non-linear quests, and strategic turn-based combat designed to be accessible and family-friendly. The core objective is to provide a shared, G-rated social experience where players can work together to achieve collective goals.
