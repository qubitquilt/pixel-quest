# **Requirements**

### **Functional**

* **FR1: Player Management:** The game must support 1 to 4 concurrent players in a single game session.  
* **FR2: Character Selection:** At the start of a session, each player must be able to select a hero from available classes (e.g., Warrior, Mage, Archer, Tinkerer). For the MVP, only the Warrior class is required.  
* **FR3: World Generation:** The game world must be dynamically generated as players explore new areas. Once an area is generated, its state (layout, landmarks) must be persistent for the duration of the session.  
* **FR4: Overworld Exploration:** Players must be able to navigate their characters through the generated world using top-down controls.  
* **FR5: Enemy Engagement:** When a player makes contact with an enemy in the overworld, the game must transition all nearby party members to a dedicated combat screen.  
* **FR6: Turn-Based Combat:** Combat must be turn-based. On their turn, a player must be able to choose actions for their character, including a "Primary Attack" and a "Special Attack."  
* **FR7: Stamina System:** Special Attacks must consume a finite "Stamina" resource. This resource should not regenerate automatically during combat but can be restored through other means (e.g., items, resting).  
* **FR8: Non-Linear Quests:** The game must present players with major quests that can be completed in any order. For the MVP, at least one main quest must be fully implemented.  
* **FR9: Multiplayer Loot System:** Common loot (e.g., coins, consumables) dropped by enemies must be instanced for each player. Key quest items or unique gear must be shared with the entire party upon pickup.  
* **FR10: Player Defeat & Revival:** When a player's health reaches zero during combat, they are removed from the current battle. They must be automatically revived with partial health after the battle concludes successfully.  
* **FR11: Team-Based Puzzles:** Quests may include puzzles that are designed for teamwork but must also be solvable by a single player to ensure game progression is never halted.

### **Non-Functional**

* **NFR1: Technology Stack:** The game client must be built using the PixiJS rendering engine.  
* **NFR2: Multiplayer Stability:** The network session for a 4-player game must remain stable without critical errors or disconnections for at least one continuous hour of gameplay.  
* **NFR3: Combat Transition Speed:** The transition from overworld exploration to the turn-based combat screen (and back again) must complete in under 2 seconds.  
* **NFR4: Aesthetic Cycles:** The game must feature a day/night cycle and seasonal changes. These changes are purely aesthetic and must not impact core game mechanics.  
* **NFR5: Content Rating:** All game content, including visuals, text, and themes, must be G-rated and appropriate for a family-friendly audience (ages 8+).  
* **NFR6: Onboarding Simplicity:** Core mechanics (movement, primary attack) must be intuitive enough for a new player to grasp within the first 5 minutes of gameplay without a lengthy, forced tutorial.
