## **Story**

As a player,  
I want to fight a unique and challenging boss at the end of a quest,  
so that I feel a sense of accomplishment.

## **Acceptance Criteria**

1. A unique "Quest Boss" robot is created with more health and a unique special attack compared to regular enemies.  
2. This boss is located at the end of the Sunstone Well area.  
3. The turn-based combat system is used for the boss battle.  
4. Defeating the boss updates the quest state to "completed".  
5. Upon quest completion, a "Quest Complete" message is displayed to all players, and the party receives a shared key item.

## **Tasks / Subtasks**

* [ ] Design the boss's unique attributes (health, attack, special abilities).
* [ ] Create the boss's sprite and animations.
* [ ] Implement the boss's AI and special attack logic within the turn-based combat system.
* [ ] Ensure the boss is spawned only in the designated Sunstone Well area.
* [ ] Implement server-side logic to update the quest status to "completed" upon boss defeat.
* [ ] Implement client-side logic to display a "Quest Complete" message and award the shared key item.

## **Dev Notes**

This story culminates the "The Sunstone Well" quest by introducing a challenging boss encounter. It leverages the existing combat system while adding unique boss mechanics and integrates with the quest management system.

### **Architecture Alignment**

* **Game Logic Engine**: Extends the combat system to handle boss-specific mechanics.
* **Game State Manager**: Updates quest status based on boss defeat.
* **AI Generation Module**: The placement of a specific, non-random quest area is a pattern that will be important for the AI Generation module later on.

### **Tech Stack**

* **Backend**: Node.js, Socket.IO
* **Frontend**: PixiJS

## **Testing**

* Verify that the boss appears only in the Sunstone Well area.
* Test the boss's unique attacks and abilities.
* Ensure the turn-based combat system functions correctly with the boss.
* Verify that defeating the boss correctly updates the quest status.
* Confirm that the "Quest Complete" message is displayed and the key item is awarded.
