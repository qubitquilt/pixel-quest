# **Epic 5: Scoring & Round Progression**

**Epic Goal:** To implement the complete scoring logic and the flow for progressing through a multi-round match.

* **Story 5.1:** As a server, I want to manage a time-depleting treasure score for each round, along with an accelerating audible beat.  
* **Story 5.2:** As a developer, I want to create a UI component that displays the current round, match score, and other key game info.  
* **Story 5.3:** As a server, I want to calculate scores for all players upon round completion based on the defined proportional distance logic.  
* **Story 5.4:** As a client, I want to display a round summary screen with scores when the round ends.  
* **Story 5.5:** As a developer, I need to implement the match logic to track round progression and declare a final winner.
