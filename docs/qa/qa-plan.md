# **QA & Test Plan**

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** September 2, 2025

## **1. Introduction**

This document outlines the Quality Assurance (QA) and testing strategy for "Pixel Quest." The goal is to ensure the delivery of a stable, functional, and enjoyable game by systematically testing all aspects of the application, from individual components to the end-to-end multiplayer experience.

## **2. Testing Scope**

This plan covers the testing of all features defined in the Product Requirements Document (PRD) for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP).

*   **In Scope:**
    *   Core Gameplay Loop (Solo and Multiplayer)
    *   First Quest: "The Sunstone Well"
    *   Client & Server Stability
    *   User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX)
*   **Out of Scope for MVP:**
    *   Performance testing under heavy load (beyond 4 players).
    *   Formal security penetration testing.
    *   Testing on mobile devices or with gamepads.

## **3. Testing Levels & Methods**

We will employ a multi-layered testing approach, aligning with the development process.

### **Level 1: Unit Testing**

*   **Objective:** To verify that individual functions and components work correctly in isolation.
*   **Owner:** Developer Agent
*   **Framework:** TBD (e.g., Jest, Vitest)
*   **Examples:**
    *   A function that calculates combat damage.
    *   A utility that parses quest data.
    *   A React component for a UI button (if applicable).
*   **Process:** Developers will write unit tests alongside the features they build. All new logic should be covered by unit tests.

### **Level 2: Integration Testing**

*   **Objective:** To test the interaction between different components of the system.
*   **Owner:** Developer Agent / QA Agent
*   **Framework:** TBD (e.g., Jest, Supertest for API endpoints)
*   **Examples:**
    *   Client's `NetworkService` correctly sending and receiving events from the server's `ConnectionManager`.
    *   `GameStateManager` correctly updating the `QuestManager` when a quest objective is met.
    *   The transition from the `OverworldScene` to the `CombatScene`.
*   **Process:** Integration tests will be written for critical workflows, especially those involving the client-server communication layer.

### **Level 3: End-to-End (E2E) Testing**

*   **Objective:** To simulate a full user journey and test the entire application workflow from start to finish.
*   **Owner:** QA Agent
*   **Framework:** Manual testing based on defined test cases.
*   **Examples:**
    *   **Multiplayer Session Test:** Two players connect, see each other, move around, and successfully disconnect.
    *   **Full Quest Test:** A player starts the game, receives the "Sunstone Well" quest, navigates to the area, defeats the boss, and sees the quest status update to "completed."
*   **Process:** The QA Agent will execute the manual test cases outlined in Section 5 of this document after each major feature is delivered.

### **Level 4: User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**

*   **Objective:** To validate that the game meets the requirements and expectations of the target users.
*   **Owner:** Product Owner / User
*   **Process:** The Product Owner and volunteer testers (e.g., family members) will play the game and provide feedback. This is the final check to ensure the game is fun, intuitive, and meets the goals defined in the PRD.

## **4. Defect Management**

*   **Bug Tracking:** A bug tracking system (e.g., GitHub Issues) will be used to log, prioritize, and track defects.
*   **Priority Levels:**
    *   **P0 (Critical):** A crash or issue that completely blocks gameplay.
    *   **P1 (High):** A major feature is not working correctly, or a significant visual/functional bug.
    *   **P2 (Medium):** A minor feature issue or a noticeable but non-blocking bug.
    *   **P3 (Low):** A cosmetic issue or a suggestion for improvement.
*   **Triage:** The Product Manager and QA Agent will review new bugs daily to assign priority and assign them for fixing.

## **5. Manual Test Cases (MVP)**

This section provides high-level manual test cases for E2E testing.

| Test Case ID | Description | Steps | Expected Result |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **TC-01** | **Solo Gameplay Loop** | 1. Start the game. <br> 2. Move the character. <br> 3. Collide with an enemy. <br> 4. Select "Attack" in combat. <br> 5. Win the battle. | 1. Player character appears and moves. <br> 2. Game transitions to combat screen. <br> 3. Enemy health decreases. <br> 4. Game returns to overworld; enemy is gone. |
| **TC-02** | **Multiplayer Connection** | 1. Start server. <br> 2. Connect Client 1. <br> 3. Connect Client 2. | 1. Client 1 loads into the world. <br> 2. Client 2 loads in; sees Client 1's character. <br> 3. Client 1 sees Client 2's character. |
| **TC-03** | **Multiplayer Movement Sync** | 1. Perform TC-02. <br> 2. Move character on Client 1. <br> 3. Move character on Client 2. | 1. Client 1's movement is reflected on Client 2's screen. <br> 2. Client 2's movement is reflected on Client 1's screen. |
| **TC-04** | **Quest Log Verification** | 1. Start the game. <br> 2. Open the Main Menu. <br> 3. Navigate to the Quest Log. | 1. The "Reclaim the Sunstone Well" quest is listed with a status of "Not Started." |
| **TC-05** | **Player Disconnect** | 1. Perform TC-02. <br> 2. Close Client 2. | 1. Client 2's character sprite is removed from Client 1's screen. |
