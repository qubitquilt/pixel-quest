# **Source Tree**

This document defines the monorepo's directory and file structure for "Pixel Quest." The structure is designed to be logical, scalable, and to clearly separate the concerns of the client, server, and shared code.

## **Root Level**

The root of the project contains configuration files that apply to the entire monorepo, as well as the primary `packages` directory that houses the individual applications.

```
/Users/michaelruelas/code/quibitquilt/pixel-quest/
├─── .gitignore
├─── docs/
├─── node_modules/
├─── packages/
│   ├─── client/
│   └─── server/
├─── package.json
└─── README.md
```

*   **`docs/`**: Contains all project documentation, including architecture, requirements, and user stories.
*   **`packages/`**: The core directory for the monorepo, containing all runnable code and libraries.
    *   **`client/`**: The PixiJS game client.
    *   **`server/`**: The Node.js backend server.
*   **`package.json`**: The root `package.json` defines the npm workspaces and contains scripts for managing the entire project (e.g., `npm run dev`, `npm run build`).

## **`packages/client` - The Game Client**

This package contains all the code for the player-facing game, built with Vite and PixiJS.

```
packages/client/
├─── dist/
├─── public/
│   └─── assets/
├─── src/
│   ├─── components/
│   ├─── scenes/
│   ├─── services/
│   └─── main.js
├─── index.html
├─── package.json
└─── vite.config.js
```

*   **`dist/`**: The output directory for the production build, generated by Vite. This is what the server will serve.
*   **`public/`**: Static assets that are copied directly to the build output.
    *   **`assets/`**: Game assets like sprite sheets, sound effects, and music.
*   **`src/`**: The main source code for the client application.
    *   **`components/`**: Reusable game objects and UI elements (e.g., `Player.js`, `Enemy.js`, `Button.js`).
    *   **`scenes/`**: High-level game views that manage different parts of the game (e.g., `OverworldScene.js`, `CombatScene.js`, `MenuScene.js`).
    *   **`services/`**: Modules for handling cross-cutting concerns, like input or network communication (e.g., `InputManager.js`, `NetworkService.js`).
    *   **`main.js`**: The main entry point of the client application where the PixiJS app is initialized.
*   **`index.html`**: The main HTML file for the web application.

## **`packages/server` - The Backend Server**

This package contains the Node.js, Express, and Socket.IO code for the authoritative game server.

```
packages/server/
├─── src/
│   ├─── game/
│   ├─── models/
│   ├─── index.js
└─── package.json
```

*   **`src/`**: The main source code for the server application.
    *   **`game/`**: Core game logic and state management (e.g., `GameSession.js`, `QuestManager.js`).
    *   **`models/`**: Data models for game entities (e.g., `PlayerState.js`). This is a candidate for being moved to a shared package later.
    *   **`index.js`**: The main entry point for the server, where the Express and Socket.IO servers are initialized and started.
