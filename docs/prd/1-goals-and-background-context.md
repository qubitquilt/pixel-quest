# **1. Goals and Background Context**

This document outlines the requirements for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of the "Multiplayer Maze Racer" game. The primary goal is to create a fun, browser-based, 4-player maze game that serves as a practical learning project for a father-son team using Phaser. The project is intentionally scoped to be achievable and fun, focusing on core mechanics over extensive features.
