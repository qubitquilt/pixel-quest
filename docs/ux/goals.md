# **User Interface Design Goals**

### **Overall UX Vision**

The user experience should be simple, intuitive, and immediately familiar to anyone who has played a classic top-down adventure game. The UI must be clean and unobtrusive, keeping the focus on exploration and cooperative play. All interactions, from menu navigation to combat commands, should be easily understandable for an 8-year-old player.

### **Key Interaction Paradigms**

* **Overworld:** Direct control via keyboard (WASD/Arrow Keys) or gamepad. Interaction with objects (chests, NPCs) will be a single button press when adjacent.  
* **Combat:** Menu-driven, turn-based commands. Players will select actions from a simple list (Attack, Special, Item, Flee).  
* **Menus:** Full-screen overlay for inventory, quest log, and game options. Navigation will be simple, using up/down/select controls.

### **Core Screens and Views**

* **Title Screen:** Presents the game title and options to "Start New Game" or "Join Game".  
* **Character Select Screen:** A simple screen where each player (1-4) can choose their character class.  
* **Overworld HUD:** A minimal heads-up display showing the player's health, stamina, and currently selected item. For multiplayer, it will show a condensed status for all party members.  
* **Combat Screen:** A dedicated view showing the player characters on one side and enemies on the other. A command menu will be clearly visible at the bottom for the active player.  
* **Main Menu / Inventory:** A grid-based inventory screen for viewing and using items. Will also have tabs for Quest Log, Party Status, and Options.

### **Accessibility: WCAG AA**

While we are aiming for a retro aesthetic, the UI must meet modern accessibility standards. This includes clear, high-contrast text, distinguishable UI elements without relying solely on color, and full navigability using only a keyboard or gamepad.

### **Branding**

The branding should evoke the classic 8-bit era. This means pixel art, a limited but vibrant color palette, and chiptune-style music and sound effects. The overall feel should be adventurous and slightly whimsical, avoiding anything too dark or serious to maintain its G-rated, family-friendly appeal.

### **Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive**

The primary target is a web browser on a desktop or laptop. The game's display should be responsive, adapting cleanly to different browser window sizes and screen resolutions. While not a primary target for the MVP, the design should not preclude future support for mobile or tablet browsers with on-screen controls.
