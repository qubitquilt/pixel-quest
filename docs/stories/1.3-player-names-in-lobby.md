# Story 1.3: Player Names in Lobby

## Status
- [ ] Draft
- [ ] Approved
- [ ] In Progress
- [ ] Review
- [ ] Done

## Story
**As a** player joining a game,
**I want** to see my name and other players' names appear in the lobby,
**so that** I know who is in the game.

## Acceptance Criteria
1.  When a player joins a lobby, their name is added to a list of players.
2.  The list of all player names in the lobby is visible to everyone in the lobby.
3.  When a player leaves the lobby, their name is removed from the list.
4.  The host's name is also visible in the player list.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] **Backend:** Update the server-side game state to include a list of player names.
- [ ] **Backend:** Implement WebSocket events for players joining and leaving the lobby to broadcast the updated player list.
- [ ] **Frontend:** Create a UI component to display the list of player names in the lobby.
- [ ] **Frontend:** Subscribe to WebSocket events to receive the player list and update the UI in real-time.
- [ ] **Frontend:** Implement the logic for a player to enter their name.

## Dev Notes
- This story builds upon the game session and lobby created in stories 1.1 and 1.2.
- The WebSocket connection established for the lobby will be used to sync player names.
- Refer to `packages/server/src/game/game.gateway.ts` (if it exists) for WebSocket handling.
- Refer to `packages/client/app/lobby/[gameId]/page.tsx` (if it exists) for the lobby UI.

### Testing
- Test file location: `packages/client/e2e/lobby.spec.ts`, `packages/server/src/game/game.gateway.spec.ts`
- Test standards: Use Playwright for E2E tests and Jest for unit tests.
- Ensure tests cover players joining, leaving, and multiple players in the lobby.
