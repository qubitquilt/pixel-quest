# **Epic 6: Power-Up System**

**Epic Goal:** To add depth and replayability by allowing players to find and use four unique power-ups.

* **Story 6.1:** As a server, I want to spawn power-up items at random, valid locations within the maze at the start of each round.  
* **Story 6.2:** As a player, I want to see and collide with power-up items to collect them, which then removes them from the map for all players.  
* **Story 6.3:** As a developer, I need a UI element to show the player which power-up they are currently holding.  
* **Story 6.4:** As a player, I want to press the spacebar to activate my collected power-up, triggering its effect.  
* **Story 6.5:** As a developer, I need to implement the server-side logic for each of the four power-up effects (Speed Boost, Brighter Flashlight, X-Ray Vision, and Blackout).
