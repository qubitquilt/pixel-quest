# **Epic 1: Project & Lobby Setup**

**Epic Goal:** To establish the basic project structure and allow players to create, join, and start a game from a shared lobby.

* **Story 1.1:** As a host, I want to initialize a new game session on the server so that a lobby is ready for my friends.  
* **Story 1.2:** As a host, I want to see a unique, shareable URL on the lobby screen so that I can easily invite my friends.  
* **Story 1.3:** As a player joining a game, I want to see my name and other players' names appear in the lobby so I know who is in the game.  
* **Story 1.4:** As a host, I want the "Start Game" button to be enabled only when at least one other player has joined.
