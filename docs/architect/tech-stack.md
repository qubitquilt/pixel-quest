# **Tech Stack**

This document outlines the technologies, frameworks, and libraries chosen for the "Pixel Quest" project. The selection is guided by the project's requirements for a real-time, multiplayer, web-based game with a retro 8-bit aesthetic.

## **Client (Frontend)**

*   **Core Rendering Engine: PixiJS (v7.x)**
    *   **Rationale:** PixiJS is a mature and powerful 2D rendering library for HTML5. It provides the necessary tools for sprite management, animations, and effects to create the desired 8-bit aesthetic while delivering high performance in the browser.
*   **Build Tool & Dev Server: Vite (v5.x)**
    *   **Rationale:** Vite offers a fast development experience with near-instant Hot Module Replacement (HMR). Its simple configuration and efficient production builds make it an ideal choice for a modern web project.
*   **Language: JavaScript (ES6+)**
    *   **Rationale:** Standard JavaScript is sufficient for the client-side logic. Its ubiquity and the rich ecosystem of libraries make it a practical choice.
*   **Real-time Communication: Socket.IO Client (v4.x)**
    *   **Rationale:** The Socket.IO client library provides a robust and easy-to-use interface for connecting to the backend WebSocket server, handling events, and managing the real-time data flow required for multiplayer.

## **Server (Backend)**

*   **Runtime Environment: Node.js (v20.x LTS)**
    *   **Rationale:** Node.js is a non-blocking, event-driven runtime that is highly suitable for real-time applications like games. Its performance and scalability are well-suited for managing WebSocket connections and game state.
*   **Web Framework: Express (v4.x)**
    *   **Rationale:** Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework. It will be used to serve the client application and handle any future HTTP-based API needs.
*   **Real-time Communication: Socket.IO (v4.x)**
    *   **Rationale:** Socket.IO is the industry standard for building real-time applications. It provides features like automatic reconnection, event-based communication, and broadcasting to rooms (game sessions), which are essential for the multiplayer architecture.
*   **Language: JavaScript (ES6+)**
    *   **Rationale:** Using JavaScript on both the client and server allows for potential code sharing (e.g., data models, validation logic) and simplifies the development context.

## **Development & Tooling**

*   **Package Manager: npm (v10.x) with Workspaces**
    *   **Rationale:** npm with workspaces is the standard for managing monorepos in the Node.js ecosystem. It allows us to manage the `client` and `server` packages within a single repository, simplifying dependency management and cross-package scripting.
*   **Version Control: Git**
    *   **Rationale:** Git is the de facto standard for version control, enabling effective collaboration and change tracking.
*   **Code Quality: ESLint & Prettier**
    *   **Rationale:** (To be implemented) ESLint will enforce consistent coding style and catch potential errors early. Prettier will automatically format code to maintain a consistent style across the codebase.

## **Deployment (Future)**

*   **Hosting:** The application will be designed to be deployed on any modern cloud platform that supports Node.js (e.g., Heroku, Render, AWS, Google Cloud).
*   **Database:** (Future) If persistent storage beyond a single session is required, a NoSQL database like Firestore or MongoDB would be a suitable choice for storing player data and game state.
