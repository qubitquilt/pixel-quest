**Date:** September 2, 2025  
**Author:** Gemini (Product Manager AI)  
**Status:** Draft

## **1. Introduction & Purpose**

This document outlines the product requirements for "Pixel Quest," a 1-4 player cooperative, 8-bit adventure game. The purpose of this PRD is to define the project's goals, features, and scope to serve as a single source of truth for the development team. It is a living document that will be updated as the project evolves.

## **2. Vision & Problem Statement**

*   **Vision:** To create a charming, accessible, and replayable retro-style RPG that brings families and friends together for a shared, cooperative adventure.
*   **Problem Statement:** Many modern cooperative games are too complex for casual, drop-in play, while classic retro games lack robust multiplayer. "Pixel Quest" aims to fill this gap by combining the strategic depth of 8-bit RPGs with modern, family-friendly cooperative design.

## **3. Target Audience**

The primary audience is **"The Family Adventurers."** This includes:
*   Parents playing with their children (ages 8+).
*   Groups of friends with varying gaming skill levels.
*   Players looking for a casual, non-competitive, G-rated social experience.

These users need a game that is easy to learn, supports drop-in/drop-out play, and focuses on teamwork and collective achievement.

## **4. Product Goals & Success Metrics**

| Goal | Success Metric |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Deliver a compelling MVP** | Launch a stable version with the full core gameplay loop and the first main quest ("The Sunstone Well") fully implemented. |
| **Foster Cooperative Play** | A majority of player groups who start a quest complete it together. |
| **Ensure Intuitive Onboarding** | A new player can understand and perform core actions (move, attack) within the first 5 minutes of play. |
| **Achieve Technical Stability** | A 4-player session remains stable with no critical errors for at least one continuous hour of gameplay. |

## **5. Features & Epics**

### **Epic 1: Core Engine & Solo Gameplay Loop**
*Goal: To establish a playable, single-player experience that proves out the core technical foundations of the game, including rendering, movement, and the fundamental turn-based combat system.*

*   **Story 1.1: Project Scaffolding & Basic Rendering:** Set up the monorepo with a PixiJS client and a Node.js server to render a basic game screen.
*   **Story 1.2: Player Character & Movement:** Render a controllable, animated player character that can move around the game world.
*   **Story 1.3: Procedural Tilemap Generation:** Create a dynamically generated, persistent tile-based world with basic collision.
*   **Story 1.4: Overworld Enemy & Combat Transition:** Place enemies in the overworld that trigger a transition to a combat screen on contact.
*   **Story 1.5: Turn-Based Combat System (Solo):** Implement a client-side, turn-based combat system with basic attack and turn-alternating logic.

### **Epic 2: Multiplayer & Session Management**
*Goal: To transform the single-player experience into a fully cooperative one by implementing the network architecture, allowing multiple players to join a game, see each other, and interact within the same game world.*

*   **Story 2.1: Basic WebSocket Server:** Set up a WebSocket server to handle persistent, real-time client connections.
*   **Story 2.2: Client Connection & Session Creation:** Enable the game client to connect to the server and join a shared game session.
*   **Story 2.3: Multiplayer Character Spawning & State Sync:** Ensure players can see each other's characters, and that the game state is synchronized when players join or leave.
*   **Story 2.4: Real-time Movement Synchronization:** Synchronize player movement across all clients in real-time.

### **Epic 3: Quest System & First Quest**
*Goal: To implement the systems necessary for questing and to create one full, playable quest from start to finish, including puzzle elements and a unique boss battle, thereby completing the core gameplay loop for the MVP.*

*   **Story 3.1: Quest Management System:** Create a server-side system to define and track the state of quests and display their status in the UI.
*   **Story 3.2: First Quest - "The Sunstone Well":** Implement the first main quest with a unique world area and objectives.
*   **Story 3.3: Team-Based Puzzle:** Add a simple, cooperative puzzle within the Sunstone Well that is solvable by one or more players.
*   **Story 3.4: Boss Battle Encounter:** Create a unique boss battle at the end of the quest, which, upon completion, updates the quest status and rewards the players.
