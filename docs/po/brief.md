# **Project Brief: Pixel Quest**

## **Executive Summary**

"Pixel Quest" is an 8-bit, 4-player cooperative adventure game where heroes reclaim a vast, dynamic kingdom from an army of corrupting living machines. Players will explore a persistent, procedurally generated world, engage in strategic turn-based combat, and complete non-linear quests to dismantle mechanical bosses and restore the kingdom's key infrastructure. The core value is providing a collaborative, family-friendly, and replayable retro-style RPG experience.

## **Problem Statement**

Many modern cooperative games can be overly complex, inaccessible to younger players, or require a significant, linear time commitment, making casual, drop-in play sessions difficult for families. Existing retro-style games often lack robust, built-in multiplayer functionality. There is a need for a game that captures the charm and strategic depth of classic 8-bit RPGs while being designed from the ground up for a shared, G-rated, family-friendly experience that accommodates players of different skill levels and schedules.

## **Proposed Solution**

Our solution is a top-down, 8-bit adventure game built with PixiJS, designed for 1-4 players. The game differentiates itself through a unique combination of features: a dynamically generated yet persistent open world, a real-time day/night and seasonal cycle for aesthetic variety, and a non-linear quest system allowing players to tackle major objectives in any order. The core gameplay loop revolves around exploration, strategic turn-based combat against mechanical foes, and solving team-oriented puzzles. By focusing on contained, objective-based quests and a simple, engaging combat system, the game provides a satisfying cooperative experience that is easy to jump into for short or long play sessions.

## **Target Users**

### **Primary User Segment: The Family Adventurers**

* **Profile:** This group includes parents playing with their children (ages 8+), siblings, or groups of friends looking for a casual, non-competitive cooperative game. They have varying levels of gaming experience, from seasoned players to beginners.  
* **Behaviors:** They play in sessions that can range from 30 minutes to a few hours. They value games that are easy to learn but offer enough depth to remain engaging. Drop-in/drop-out multiplayer is a huge plus.  
* **Needs & Pain Points:** They need a game that is appropriate for all ages (G-rated). They are frustrated by games with steep learning curves, overly complex mechanics, or content that isn't family-friendly. They dislike games where one highly-skilled player can leave everyone else behind.  
* **Goals:** Their primary goal is to have a fun, shared social experience. They want to work together to overcome challenges, solve puzzles, and feel a sense of collective accomplishment.

## **Goals & Success Metrics**

### **Business Objectives**

* **Deliver a Playable MVP:** Create a feature-complete version of the game with 1-4 player support, turn-based combat, and at least two of the five main quests fully implemented.  
* **Technical Skill Showcase:** Successfully implement the core technical pillars: a persistent procedurally generated world and stable multiplayer functionality using PixiJS.  
* **Collaborative Experience:** Serve as a successful and enjoyable father-son project, fostering learning and collaboration.

### **User Success Metrics**

* **High Quest Completion Rate:** A majority of player groups who start a quest are able to successfully complete it together.  
* **Intuitive Onboarding:** A new player (ideally an 8-year-old) can understand and perform core actions (move, attack, special attack) within the first 5 minutes of play without extensive tutorials.  
* **Positive Cooperative Play:** Players frequently use teamwork to overcome challenges, indicated by reviving teammates and solving team-based puzzles.

### **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**

* **Stable Multiplayer Sessions:** The game can maintain a stable connection for a 4-player session for at least one hour without critical errors.  
* **Turn-Based Combat Flow:** The transition from world exploration to turn-based combat and back is smooth and takes less than 2 seconds.
