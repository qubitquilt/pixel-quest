# **Story 3.3: Team-Based Puzzle**

## **Status**

* [ ] Approved  
* [ ] InProgress  
* [ ] Review  
* [ ] Done

## **Story**

As a player,  
I want to solve a puzzle with my teammates,  
so that we can progress through the quest.

## **Acceptance Criteria**

1. The Sunstone Well area contains a simple puzzle, such as requiring two players to stand on separate pressure plates simultaneously to open a door.  
2. The puzzle state is synchronized across all clients.  
3. The puzzle is designed to be solvable by a single player (e.g., by finding a heavy object to place on one of the plates).

## **Tasks / Subtasks**

* [ ] Design the specific mechanics of the team-based puzzle for the Sunstone Well area.
* [ ] Implement the client-side logic for the puzzle elements (e.g., pressure plates, doors).
* [ ] Implement the server-side logic to synchronize the puzzle state across all connected clients.
* [ ] Ensure the puzzle can be solved by a single player using alternative methods (e.g., pushing a heavy object onto a plate).

## **Dev Notes**

This story introduces interactive puzzle elements into the game, emphasizing cooperative play while ensuring solo progression is still possible. This is a key part of the "The Sunstone Well" quest.

### **Architecture Alignment**

* **Game Logic Engine**: Adds new puzzle-solving logic to the server.
* **Game State Manager**: The server will need to manage the state of the puzzle elements.
* **Multiplayer Synchronization**: Requires robust real-time synchronization of puzzle states.

### **Tech Stack**

* **Backend**: Node.js, Socket.IO
* **Frontend**: PixiJS

## **Testing**

* Verify that the puzzle elements are rendered correctly on the client.
* Confirm that player interactions (e.g., standing on a pressure plate) affect the puzzle state.
* Verify that the puzzle state is synchronized across multiple clients.
* Test that the puzzle can be solved by multiple players cooperating.
* Test that the puzzle can be solved by a single player using the alternative method.
