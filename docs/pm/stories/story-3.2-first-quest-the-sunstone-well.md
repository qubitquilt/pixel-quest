# **Story 3.2: First Quest \- "The Sunstone Well"**

## **Status**

* \[x\] Draft  
* \[ \] Approved  
* \[ \] InProgress  
* \[ \] Review  
* \[ \] Done

## **Story**

As a player,  
I want to receive and complete a quest to reclaim The Sunstone Well,  
so that I can achieve a major objective.

## **Acceptance Criteria**

1. The "Reclaim the Sunstone Well" quest is defined in the quest system and is available from the start.  
2. A new, specific area for the Sunstone Well is generated in the world.  
3. The quest objectives are displayed in the Quest Log UI.  
4. Completing the quest involves defeating a specific boss located within the Sunstone Well area.

## **Tasks / Subtasks**

* \[ \] Add the "Reclaim the Sunstone Well" quest data to the quests.json file.  
* \[ \] Update the world generation logic to include a specific, uniquely identifiable "Sunstone Well" area. This area should not be random.  
* \[ \] On the client, update the Quest Log UI to show more detailed objectives for the active quest.  
* \[ \] Create a specific "Boss" enemy type.  
* \[ \] Ensure an instance of this Boss enemy is spawned only within the Sunstone Well area.  
* \[ \] On the server, add logic so that when the boss is defeated (which will be implemented in a later story), the state of this quest is updated to "completed".  
* \[ \] The client's Quest Log UI should update in real-time to reflect the new "completed" status.

## **Dev Notes**

This story gives the players their first concrete goal. It connects the world generation system with the quest system. The actual boss fight mechanics will be handled in story-3.4-boss-battle-encounter.

### **Architecture Alignment**

* **Game Logic Engine**: Tightly integrates the world generation, enemy placement, and quest state systems.  
* **AI Generation Module**: The placement of a specific, non-random quest area is a pattern that will be important for the AI Generation module later on.

### **Tech Stack**

* **Backend**: Node.js, Socket.IO  
* **Frontend**: PixiJS

## **Testing**

* Explore the world map and verify that a distinct "Sunstone Well" area can be found.  
* Verify a unique boss enemy is present in that area and nowhere else.  
* Check the Quest Log UI to confirm the objectives for the quest are displayed.  
* Simulate the boss's defeat on the server and verify the quest status changes to "completed" on both the server and the client's UI.
