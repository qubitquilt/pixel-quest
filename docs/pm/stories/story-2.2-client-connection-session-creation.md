## **Story**

As a player,  
I want to connect to the game server and join a game session,  
so that I can play with others.

## **Acceptance Criteria**

1. The PixiJS client establishes a WebSocket connection to the server on startup.  
2. The first player to connect creates a new game session on the server.  
3. Subsequent players are automatically added to the existing session.  
4. Each connected player is assigned a unique ID by the server.

## **Tasks / Subtasks**

* \[ \] Add the socket.io-client library as a dependency to the client package.  
* \[ \] In the client's main entry point, add code to establish a connection to the Socket.IO server.  
* \[ \] On the server, enhance the connection logic:  
  * If no game session exists, create a new one.  
  * Add the connecting player to the current game session.  
* \[ \] On the server, when a player connects, emit a connected event back to that client, sending them their unique player ID and the session ID.  
* \[ \] The client should listen for the connected event and store its player ID.

## **Dev Notes**

This story bridges the client and server. It ensures that players can join a shared game world. For the MVP, we will only support a single game session at a time.

### **Architecture Alignment**

* **Network Client**: This is the implementation of the Network Client frontend component.  
* **Game State Manager**: The server-side logic for creating and managing a game session is the beginning of the Game State Manager component.  
* **API Specification**: Implements the initial client-to-server connection handshake.

### **Tech Stack**

* **Real-time Engine**: Socket.IO (4.x) on the server, socket.io-client on the client.

## **Testing**

* Start the server.  
* Launch one game client. Verify in the server logs that a new game session is created and the player is added. The client should receive and log its unique ID.  
* Launch a second game client. Verify in the server logs that this player is added to the *existing* game session, and no new session is created. The second client should receive its own unique ID.
