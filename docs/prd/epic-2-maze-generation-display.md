# **Epic 2: Maze Generation & Display**

**Epic Goal:** To programmatically generate a fair and random maze on the server for each round and render it on all player clients.

* **Story 2.1:** As a developer, I need a maze generation algorithm on the server so that a new, fair maze can be created for each round.  
* **Story 2.2:** As a server, I want to send the complete maze data to all clients when a round starts so they can render the game world.  
* **Story 2.3:** As a client, I want to receive the maze data and render it visually using Phaser so that I can see the game board.
